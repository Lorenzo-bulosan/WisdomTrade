# WisdomTrade

## Overview
Leveraging the concept of 'wisdom of the crowd' where the average of random guesses will approach the correct result. 
This concept is explored by allowing many users to enter a price prediction of a stock at a given date and averaging the results.
The idea is to explore if the average was then close to the real price on the date.

## Unfinished
This project main platform and UI to add individual predictions and averages are completed but I want to create also a way to display realtime tickers and graphs and implement simple strategies that provides 'signals' given by this simple strategies and will eventually add more complex strategies.

## Disclaimer
This is not hosted anywhere and its meant to be a personal challenge and hobbie project. It is not suitable for production only run locally and meant to satisfy my own curiosity and my personal challenge.
